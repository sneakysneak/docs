ORBIT is LAUNCH’s companion, giving your users a screen where they can view their installed integrations as well as pause and delete them.

As a prepackaged integration management solution ORBIT is deployed in a similar fashion to LAUNCH, being made accessible to your users via a pop up, model or iframe.

ORBIT’s styling and layout can also be customised from within the Cyclr Console. You can set your own custom HTML and CSS in **Settings > Appearance Settings**

Deploying ORBIT
---------------

Set up is similar to LAUNCH, however you only the username, password and account ID need to be provided.

Access token is a parter scope token [https://cyclr.com/docs/introduction/api-authentication]()

Request to Cyclr API

```
curl -X POST
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Accept: application/json"
-d '{
    "Username": "example@example.com",
    "Password": "password",
    "AccountId": "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}' "https://yourCyclrInstance/v1.0/users/orbit"
```

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Request parameters</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Username</td>
        <td>The name of the Cyclr account (and Cyclr user) to install this integration in, or to create if such an account (and user) does not already exist.</td>
        <td>example@example.com</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Password</td>
        <td>The password to assign to the new Cyclr user account, if created.
If you do not intend your end users to access the Cyclr application directly, this password can be an obscure value known only to your app.</td>
        <td>password</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>AccountId</td>
        <td>If your user already has an account within Cyclr, specify the Id of that account to have the new integration installed there rather than a new Cyclr account.</td>
        <td>0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000</td>
    </tr>
