By default, connectors will only include the standard fields used by an app. It is therefore common to add new fields to work with fields have added in the app you are connecting.

To add a custom field:

*   From the builder’s sidebar, click to expand the app connector and click Settings
*   In the section named Methods and Fields, click to expand the category and then the method you wish to add fields to
*   Under Request Fields, click the + button to add a field

#### Definitions

*   **Field Location** – usually this is just a case of copying the syntax of the existing fields
*   **Display Name** – this is the “pretty” name as it will be shown in the user interface
*   **Description** – you can optionally describe the field, for example how it is used
*   **Data Type** – you can optionally define a data type for your field (although in almost all cases will be text)
