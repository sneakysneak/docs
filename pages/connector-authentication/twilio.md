<h3>Archiving Ended Chats</h3><p>Once a user has finished their chat session in the Twilio Chat client you don’t want your helpdesk agents to be swamped in old Slack chat windows.

<h3>Google Sheets Powered User Agent Dashboard</h3><p>Now you have your bi-directional chat helpdesk set up we want to add reporting functionality to it.</p><p>To do this, we create a Google Sheets powered dashboard. The dashboard will show you how many active chats you have in session and user agents you have available. More importantly, it will show you how to connect your Google Sheet to your helpdesk so you can extend its functionality further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><center><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvpOAm9IY3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p></center>
