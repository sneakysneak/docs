## Setup

### Authentication Credentials

To authenticate the ServiceMonster connector you will need a username and password. Please note, these are not the same as your ServiceMonster login credentials.

To obtain a username and password for use with the API/connector:

1. Login to ServiceMonster at app.servicemonster.net (You will need to use an administrator account)
2. Navigate to the Company tab and click on "Api Keys" in the Navigator menu on the left side
3. Click "New" at the bottom of the list of existing API Keys
4. Select a role, usually Admin and supply a note (optional), click "Submit"
5. A set of API Credentials will appear. Make sure you save the password, as it will not be retrievable if you lose it

### Authenticate the Connector

1. Locate the Service Monster connector

   > Cyclr Console > Connectors > Connector Library > Service Monster

2. From the Edit Connector interface click 'Setup'

3. Enter your Username and Password, click 'Next'

The connector is now authenticated and ready to use.
