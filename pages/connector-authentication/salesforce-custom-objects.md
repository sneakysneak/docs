## Accessing Custom Objects in Salesforce

First you will need the API name of your object.  The process of finding this is slightly different depending upon whether you use Salesforce *Lightning Edition* or Salesforce *Classic*.

#### Finding the API name in Salesforce (Lightning)

1. Click the Setup Cog, and choose **Setup**.

2. Select the Object Manager. (This can be also be found under **Platform Tools** > **Objects and Fields**)

3. Find the Custom Object in the list, and identify its **API Name**.  This will be something like `My_Custom_Object__C`.

#### Finding the API name in Salesforce (Classic)

1. Select **Setup**
2. In the left navigational menu, select **Build** > **Create** > **Objects**
3. Find the Custom Object in the list, and select it by clicking its name.
4. In the next screen you will see the object's **API Name**.  This will be something like `My_Custom_Object__C`.

#### Using the Custom Object within Cyclr

1. Access Connector Settings for the Salesforce Connector.

2. From the **Custom Objects** > **Utilities** sub-category, run **List Object Fields**, passing in the API Name of your object.

3. Copy the list of field names from the response.

4. Select which of the three available custom objects numbered 1-3 will be used for this object.  If for example you choose 1, use the **Custom Objects** > **Object 1** method group to set up access.

5. Run the method **List Records 1**, passing the API Name as the **Object Name**, and the field list that you previously copied into the **Fields** box.  This will provide you with a sample of data in the object.

6. Once this has run scroll down to the Method Response section of the results and copy it.

7. On the method, switch tabs from **Test** back to **Fields**.

8. Click the magnifying glass to bring up the **Generate Fields** window.  Paste the response from step 6 in here and click **Generate**.  This will add all the required fields to your List Records method.

9. Repeat steps 5-8, this time using the method **Get Record By ID 1**.  If you need an ID to use here, you can find one by running **List Records** again.
