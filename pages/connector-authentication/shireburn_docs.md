## API Keys

The Shireburn connector is authenticated with two API Keys.

### Open API Key

To obtain an Open API Key you must first create a user account and assign that user the relevant permissions. The steps necessary to do this are described [here](http://indigohelp.shireburn.com/en/articles/3203157-how-to-obtain-an-open-api-key-in-indigo-beta).

### Azure API Key

To obtain your Azure API Key you must first create a developer account and subscribe to the 'Payroll Standard' product.
The steps necessary to do this are described [here](http://indigohelp.shireburn.com/en/articles/3203147-create-your-indigo-api-developer-account-and-subscribe-to-a-product-beta).

Once the state of your Payroll Standard subscription changes to 'Active' you will see a 'Primary Key'. This is your Azure API Key.

> It can take several hours for your subscription to be activated. If necessary contact Shireburn support for assistance.
