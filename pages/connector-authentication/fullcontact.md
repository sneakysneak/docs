<h2>Organising Contacts</h2>
<p>Share, sync and collaborate with your team using FullContact’s latest contact management solution. Segment your

        platform)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Collect Contacts by Team</h3>

<h3>Field Mapping Example</h3>
<p>In this example workflow, a Cycle is triggered when a Contact Form 7 form is submitted. Before the contact form data
    is sent to Salesforce it is sent to FullContact to discover more information on the user.</p>

<p>You can then pass data values from the FullContact connector to your CRM, which is shown below being mapped in the
    Salesforce connector.</p>
