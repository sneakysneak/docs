# Intercom #

Partner Setup
-------------

Intercom uses OAuth 2 for remote API access. You must register Cyclr within Intercom as your own App to receive OAuth Client ID and Client Secret values to enable Cyclr to authenticate with Intercom.

The official Intercom documentation describing the process can be found here:
[Creating an App](https://developers.intercom.com/building-apps/docs/get-started-developing-on-intercom)
[Setting up OAuth](https://developers.intercom.com/building-apps/docs/setting-up-oauth)


You'll need to create an app in Intercom and set up Oauth on the app to get the client Id and client secret.
