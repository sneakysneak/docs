## Partner Setup

First, login to your existing Lizzy account.

#### API Key

Before you can use the Lizzy API, you must be granted access by the customer you're wishing to do business with. 

To learn more about this option the Lizzy customer should watch video in Interface Setup Procedures (1.9) [Controlling Who Has Access To Your Data](https://youtu.be/zJbWNx4_rI4)

With this you can see how to set up a contact to access to access the API.

NOTE: If you are making calls on behalf of more than one Lizzy customer then you will receive a different API Key for each dealership or company. Lizzy uses them to determine which company you are working with.

API Keys are IP restricted you will need to ensure you [whitelist Cyclr's IP address].

### Cyclr Setup

Setup Lizzy within Cyclr:

When installing the connector enter the API key obtained in above steps.
