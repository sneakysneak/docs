## Connector Setup

### Obtaining Authentication Credentials

The Infusionsoft Connector is authenticated with a Client ID, Client Secret, Username and Password.

#### Client ID And Client Secret

The Client ID and Client Secret will both come from your Keap developer account. (Keap is the parent company of Infusionsoft)

You will need a developer account and a registered App. When authenticating the Connector we will link this App to the desired Infusionsoft account using these credentials.

1. If you have an account, [log in](https://keys.developer.keap.com/accounts/login). If not, [create an account](https://keys.developer.keap.com/accounts/create)

2. From the far right of the top navigation bar, click your username/email and then click 'Apps'

   > Note: The login credentials required here are **not the credentials for your developer account**. We are linking the App from your developer account to the desired Infusionsoft account.

### User Guide

The Create and Update Contacts functionality is handled with a single method 'Upsert Contacts'. This will perform a duplicate check within Infusionsoft for the entered email address. If a matching email address is found, the existing contact will be updated. If no match is found, a new contact will be created.

When entering a State or Country code it is advised that you use our Lookup feature, as the Infusionsoft API has strict requirements for valid Province and Country codes.
