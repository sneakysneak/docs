### Cyclr Setup

*   Go to your **Cyclr Console**
*   Click the **Connectors** menu along the top
*   Choose Connector Library
*   Find the **LiveForce** Connector
*   Click the **Setup** button

Enter the following values:

**Client ID**:  The Institution ID that we retrieved from the app that we made.

Your LiveForce Connector is now setup! You can test it by installing it in one of your Cyclr accounts and executing one of the methods to confirm it can return some data.
