### Cyclr Setup

Setup your Purple App within Cyclr:

*   Choose Connector Library
*   Scroll down to **Purple**
*   Click the **Setup** button

Enter the following values:

**Domain**: The Purple domain you use to login with. For example, if the URL of the website you use to login to is "https://portal.company.com/login" you would enter "portal.company.com" here.

Your Purple Connector is now setup! You can test it by installing it in one of your Cyclr accounts and executing one of the methods to confirm it can return some data.
