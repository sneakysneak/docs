## Constant Contact Setup

To use the Constant Contact connector, you will first need to setup an application within Constant Contact to obtain a `Key` and `Secret`.


### Setting up an application in Constant Contact
1. Go to the Constant Contact API Portal (https://constantcontact.mashery.com/)
2. Click `Apps & API Keys`>`Applications`>`Create a New Application`
3. Give your application an appropriate name, and enter your company name.
4. For Website, enter https://cyclr.com
5. Set the Redirect URI to htt<span></span>ps://`ServiceDomain`/connector/callback 

    > `ServiceDomain` should be substituted for your actual service domain, e.g. yourcompany-h.cyclr.com which can be found in your Cyclr Console under `Settings > Integration Settings > Service Domain`.
6. Leave `Issue a new key for Constant Contact API` selected, and set to `Standard API Access`.
7. Agree to the terms of service and click `Register Application`.
8. You will now be presented with details of your app, along with its `Key` and `Secret`.  Take note of these.

### Setting up your Constant Contact Connector

You can now use the `Key` and `Secret` from the previous stage, as `Client ID` and `Client Secret` respectively, when authenticating the connector.
