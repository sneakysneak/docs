When installing the Bronto Connector, the following documentation describes how to create an API Key and set appropriate permissions within your Bronto account:
https://help.bronto.com/bmp/concept/c_api_soap_intro.html

Here are the key points from that documentation:

* The user must be designated as having the “API Access” permission.
* Before logging into an account, the account must have the API feature enabled, and must have at least one API token created.
* If you have a Professional or Core edition account, you can create and edit API tokens by going to Settings > Platform Settings > Data Exchange in the platform. \
 \- or - \
Multi-Brand edition clients, and clients with certain versions of the Agency edition can create and edit tokens able to access all your accounts or a specific account. To create and edit API tokens in a Multi-Brand account, go to Settings > Platform Settings > Data Exchange at the Multi-Brand level.
