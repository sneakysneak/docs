## Authentication

The Microsoft Azure Active Directory connector is authenticated with the OAuth2.0 protocol. You will need to register an application and provide the connector with that application's Client ID (Application ID) and Client Secret.

Please follow Microsoft's official guide to registering an applciation in Azure Active Directory. That documentation can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

- For "Supported account types" you should select "Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)"
- Redirect URI should be {% raw %}https://{{Your Cyclr service domain e.g. app-h.cyclr.com}}/connector/callback{% endraw %}
- Client ID (Application ID) is displayed in the overview of your created app
- Generate a Client Secret by following [these steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret)

Permissions must be set for the application. The following table details the permissions required for each method category in the connector.

| Category     | Permissions                          |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Groups       | Group.Read.All, GroupMember.Read.All |
| Organization | Organization.Read.All                |
| People       | People.Read.All                      |
| Places       | Place.Read.All                       |
| Users        | User.Read.All                        |

In addition to the category specific permissions, you should add permissions for **offline_access** and **Directory.Read.All**.

To add these permissions in Azure Active Directory:

1. From **App registrations** in the Azure portal select your application
2. Select **API permissions** from the menu on the left
3. Click **+ Add a permission**. This will open the permissions menu
