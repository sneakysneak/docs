### Scripting

Cyclr supports Javascript as its scripting language, allowing you to manipulate data before it's sent as well as after it's been retrieved.  This can be useful when moving data between applications as what's valid in one, may not be valid in another.  Also, sometimes data just doesn't quite "fit".

Script can be used when building a Connector and on Steps in a Template or Cycle.

If you're working on a Cycle in the Builder and need to perform a change to some data, click the Step Setup button on a Step then either use Inline Script in a Mapping for something simple, or expand the Advanced Settings area and enter some Script to tie in to Cyclr's [Events](https://docs.cyclr.com/custom-connector-scripting#events) as described below.

For Inline Script, you must prefix the Javascript code with "=" (an equals sign), e.g.:
```javascript
=(100 * 2)
```
or
```javascript
=`[Mergefield]` === '' ? 'no value' : `[Mergefield]`;
```

It's best to use ` characters (backticks) around string values being merged in as that will prevent carriage returns and the various quote characters from breaking your Script.


### Event Handlers

Events are triggered at certain points when a Cycle runs, allowing you to modify data using "event handlers" which are simply Javascript functions.

To add an event handler, put a Javascript function at the Connector or Method level, or in the Advanced Settings area of a Step in the Cycle Builder, using the event name as the name of the function, e.g.:

```javascript
function before_action() {
    /* Handle event here */
    return true;
}
```

Event handlers entered at the Connector level will be called for all of its Methods.  Event handlers entered at the Method level will only be called for that Method.

If you need to pass a value from a **before_action** handler to an **after_action** handler and you're not able to put it in the **method_request** object as it's not considered valid by the API being called, you can use the **method_request_mergefields** object as its values are persisted across those two events.  The **script_parameters** object, for example, is not persisted across any events.


### Events

#### before_webhook

Called when a webook request has been received and before anything else is done. Method is used to decide if the request should be continued or return a custom message to the caller.

###### Global objects

*   **method_request**: The webhook request body
*   **method_request_headers**: The webhook request headers
*   **method_request_parameters**: The webhook request parameters
*   **method_endpoint**: The webhook request URL
*   **method_response**: The response body for the request
*   **method_response_headers**: The response headers for the request
*   **cycle_variables**: Allows access to Cycle variables.  Changes are not persisted.
*   **return**: true for the webhook to continue normal execution, false to stop execution of the request and send the response body/headers to the caller

#### after_webhook

Called after the webook has been caught.

###### Global object

*   **method_response**: object that was POSTed to the Cyclr webhook
*   **cycle_variables**: Allows access to Cycle variables.  Changes are not persisted.
*   **return**: true for the webhook to continue normal execution, false to ignore the webhook request

#### before_action

Called before Cyclr makes a request to an external API.

###### Global objects

*   **method_request**: object the will be posted to the third party API
*   **method_request_headers**: HTTP headers for the request
*   **method_request_parameters**: Querystring parameters for the request
*   **method_request_mergefields**: mergefields for the request
*   **cycle_variables**: Allows access to Cycle variables.  Changes are not persisted.
*   **return**: true to continue with the request to the third party API, false to abort the request (use throw for a more useful step error message)

#### after_action

Function is called when Cyclr has a response from an external API.

If a Method uses Paging, this function is called after each page is retrieved.

###### Global object

*   **method_endpoint**: The URL of the original request
*   **method_response**: object that was received from the third party API.  If the Method uses paging, this contains only the current page's Response.
*   **method_request_mergefields**: mergefields for the request
*   **cycle_variables**: Allows access to Cycle variables.  Changes are not persisted.
*   **return**: true

#### after_action_paging

If this function is provided, it is called once after all pages of data have been retrieved, whether Paging has been implemented or not.

###### Global object

*   **method_response**: object that contains all of the Response data.
*   **cycle_variables**: Allows access to Cycle variables.  Changes are not persisted.
*   **return**: true

#### after_error

Function is called when Cyclr received an error from an external API.

###### Global object

*   **error_response**: Details of the error, see : **Handle Errors from Third Party APIs** further down for more information on handling errors
*   **cycle_variables**: Allows access to Cycle variables.  Changes are not persisted.
*   **return**: true

#### action_condition

Function is used to essentially combine a Method with a Decision Step, allowing a test to be performed that directs a Transaction down either the True or False exit points.  Just by adding this function to a Step, Cyclr will add True and False exit points.

###### Global object

*   **method_response**: object that was received from the third party API.
*   **cycle_variables**: Allows access to Cycle variables.  Changes are not persisted.
*   **return**: true for the Transaction to exit on the "True Route", false to exit on the "False Route"

#### after_oauth2_refresh

Called after Cyclr makes an OAuth 2 refresh token request.

###### Global object

*   **method_response**: response object that was received from the OAuth 2 refresh token request.
*   **cycle_variables**: Allows access to Cycle variables.  Changes are not persisted.
*   **return**: true

### Functions

#### http_request

Function to make external HTTP requests.

When calling the `http_request` function, you provide a JSON object with the following properties:

*   method: HTTP method, e.g. GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
*   url: URL for the HTTP request
*   parameters: Querystring parameters
*   headers: HTTP headers
*   data: HTTP request data.  If sending JSON, you should use JSON.stringify() to serialize it.

Example:

```javascript
function after_action() {
	var response = http_request(
		{
			'method': 'POST',
			'url': 'https://someapi.com/createsomething',
			'headers':
			{
				'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + method_auth_value,
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
				'Accept': 'application/json'
			},
			'data': JSON.stringify( { "MyData": "some value" } )
		}
	);

	return true;
}
```

The Response from an `http_request` call is returned as a JSON object with these properties:

*  status_code: the HTTP Status code returned
*  headers: any HTTP headers
*  content: the Response body
*  request: details of the Request that was made


#### btoa

Function to encode a string using Base64.

#### atob

Function to decode a Base64 encoded string.

#### cyclr_sign

Function to sign a string.

For example,
```javascript
var algorithm = 'HMAC-SHA1';
var signingKey = 'This is the signing key.';
var valueToSign = 'This is the string to sign.';

var signature = cyclr_sign(algorithm, signingKey, valueToSign);
```

Supported algorithms are: `HMAC-SHA1`, `RSA-SHA1`, `RSA-SHA224`, `RSA-SHA256`, `RSA-SHA384`, `RSA-SHA512`.

### Exceptions

#### AuthSessionException

Exception to force the authentication session to be refreshed.

Upon getting this exception, Cyclr will call the *Post Install Property Value Lookup Method* to start a new session.

For example, an API returns 200 with an error code in the response when the session expires:

```javascript
function after_action() {
    if (typeof method_response.error_code !== 'undefined' &&
        method_response.error_code === 'You are not logged on.') {
        throw new AuthSessionException();
    }
    return true;
}
```

If an API returns a non-2xx HTTP status code when the auth session expires, you should throw *AuthSessionException* in *after_error*:
```javascript
function after_error() {
    if (method_error.statusCode.toString() == 403) {
        throw new AuthSessionException();
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Libraries

Before calling any function from a library, please use `require("Library Name");`.

For example:

`require("moment");`

#### Moment.js

Library Name: moment

Description: Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript.

External Documentation: <https://momentjs.com/>

#### CryptoJS

Library Name: crypto-js

Description: JavaScript library of crypto standards.

Warning: The output of encrypted data is always in a hex string. Formatting options `CryptoJS.enc` are not supported when calling `toString`.

External Documentation: <https://github.com/brix/crypto-js>

### Connector scripting examples

#### Make External Requests

You can write a script to call external API endpoints. This is especially useful if the API returns a URL which contains the real response object.

For example, a webhook returns the following object to Cyclr:

```json
{
    "event": "object.updated",
    "api_url": "http://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

Use `http_request` to call `api_url` and replace the webhook response with the updated object:

```javascript
function after_webhook() {
    var request = {
        'method': 'GET',
        'url': method_response.api_url,
        'headers': {
            'Accept': 'application/json'
        }
    };

    var content = http_request(request).content;
    method_response = content;
    return true;
}
```
    

After calling `api_url`, Cyclr will then replace `method_response` with the content of the HTTP call.

Return `false` in the `after_webhook` function will stop Cyclr from running the webhook. You can use this trick to filter webhook events.

#### Transform Key Value Pairs

Making use of key value pair responses requires the use of scripting, consider an API that returns the below representation of a contact.

```json
{
    properties: [{
        "key": "email",
        "value": "example@example.com"
    }]
}
```

To access the email field we would add a field in the method response with a connector location of **properties.email**. However this would not work as the cyclr is looking in the response for a properties object with a property named email to get the value from. To solve the issue we would add the below function into the method scripts, this function will transform the properties array into an object with properties for each key value pair.

```javascript
function after_action() {
    var original = method_response.properties;
    method_response.properties = {};

    for (var i = 0; i < original.length; i++) {
        var item = original[i];
        if (item['key'] == void(0))
            continue;

        var val = item['value'];
        if (val == void(0))
            continue;

        method_response.properties[item['key']] = val;
    }

    return true;
}
```
    

Now when cyclr runs the method if will get the following result back and the **properties.email** field will work as expected.

```json
{
    properties: {
        "email": "example@example.com"
    }
}
```    

For a corresponding request method, e.g. adding a contact, we would need the below function in the method scripts to perform the data transformation in reverse.

```javascript
function before_action() {
    var original = method_request.properties;
    method_request.properties = [];

    for (var p in original) {
        method_request.properties.push({
            'key': p,
            'value': original[p]
        });
    }
    return true;
}
```
    
#### Modify Parameters

Besides the HTTP request body, you can also use scripting to modify HTTP headers (`method_request_headers`) and query string parameters (`method_request_parameters`).

```javascript
function before_action() {
    var xmlData = '<Records><Record>';

    for (var p in method_request) {
        xmlData += '<Field val=""' + p + '"">' + method_request[p] + '</Field>';
    }

    xmlData += '</Record></Records>';
    method_request_parameters.xmlData = xmlData;
    return true;
}
```    

In this example, we transformed the method request body to a XML string and saved the string as a new parameter called `xmlData`.

#### Handle Errors from Third Party APIs

The scripting engine can be used to catch and handle errors returned from third party APIs.

*   **statusCode **– the HTTP status code returned by the third party API
*   **reasonPhrase** – the reason phrase returned by the third party API
*   **content **– the body content of the response from the third party API
*   **isError** – indicates that the error is an error. default: true, set to false if using isWarning or isSuccess
*   **isWarning **– set to true for Cyclr to log the error as a warning
*   **isSuccess **– set to true to change the error to success, update content to contain the success step data

Example: change an error to a warning

```javascript
function after_error() {
    if (method_error.statusCode.toString() == 400 && method_error.reasonPhrase == 'Email Address not valid') {
        method_error.isError = false;
        method_error.isWarning = true;
    }
    return true;
}
```

Example: change an error to a success

```javascript
function after_error() {
    if (method_error.statusCode.toString() == 400 && method_error.reasonPhrase == 'Email Address not valid') {
        method_error.isError = false;
        method_error.isSuccess = true;
        method_error.content = '{}';
    }
    return true;
}
```    

### Limitations

*   Execution time: 30 seconds. Script running will time out after 30 seconds.
*   External HTTP requests: for security reasons, we will use the same authentication method as the connector and the same authentication value when the connector was installed by the user. You cannot use the script to access or modify the authentication value.
*   The **cycle_variables** object is only available through a Step's Advanced Settings area, and not through Inline Script.  Also, any changes made to it and its properties are not persisted.
