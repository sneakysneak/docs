## Custom Conectors

With certain Cyclr price plans it is possible to create custom connectors.  These connectors are private to the Partner Organisation which created them.  

## Connector Basics

A connector may have vanrious releases.  When you add a new connector only certain basic naming details are entered.  The mail details of the specification of the connector are provided at the connector release level.  A connector can have only one 'live' release and there may be previous deprecated versions.

There may also be a draft release which is a pending update or extension to the connector. Pushing the draft release live will cause the current live release to be deprecated.

When a release is pushed live this might be done as a major release which will cause an 'update available' message to appear on all steps on templates and live integartions using the connector.  A major release should generally be used when existing methods need to be updated.  A minor release can be used when there are no changes are being made (or very minor changes are being made) to existing methods but new functionality is being added.
