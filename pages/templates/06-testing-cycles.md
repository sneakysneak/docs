You can test the steps in your cycle, by clicking their “play” button.

Test an Action Step
-------------------

To test an action step, Cyclr will generate a form with the necessary fields. Add some test data and then hit the run button to see the result.

Test a Get Step
---------------

To test a Get step, click its play button. It will then connect to their app and attempt to get some data.

Notes:

*   Cyclr may only return a small part of the data; usually the first “page”
*   Steps that get _new_ or _updated_ records, will in fact always return some data (such that you can review it)
