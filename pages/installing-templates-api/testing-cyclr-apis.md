Cyclr's interactive API references can be used to try things out, and to help you while testing and creating your own native deployment or working with data on demand.

Depending on where your Cyclr Console is hosted, you'll need to use the appropriate reference:

Cyclr Console Location | Documentation link
--- | ---
my.cyclr.com | [US API Reference](https://api.cyclr.com/docs/index)
my.cyclr.uk | [UK API Reference](https://api.cyclr.uk/docs/index)
eu.cyclr.com | [EU API Reference](https://api.eu.cyclr.com/docs/index)

\

Use your Cyclr account details to authenticate and work with all API endpoints directly within the API reference documentation.


To authenticate, expand any endpoint and click the "OFF" slider, then enter your details:

There are 2 main parts to the Cyclr API:

* **Partner level API** - where you provide the details of a **Console Administrator** and your Console's **Client ID**.

* **Account level API** - where you provide the details of an **Account User**, your Console's **Client ID**, and a Cyclr **Account ID** to work in as the Client Secret.
