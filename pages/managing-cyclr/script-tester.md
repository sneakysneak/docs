# Script Tester #

If you need to test some javascript outside of your cycle, you can do so with the Script Tester.

This can be found in your **Console**, under the **Connectors** menu.

You should start with an example object (XML/JSON etc) to run your tests on.

This might be a request from a method you wish to call, or the response from said call.

### Using the Script Tester

1. Click `Global` and paste in the object, ensuring you assign the correct datatype, and give it a useful name.<br>

2. Use the left pane to enter your javascript function(s), and in the text box above, call the method (no brackets required).<br>

3. Click **Run**, and if your javascript is valid, you will see its output in the right-hand pane.<br>

4. You can now continue to adjust your script until you're happy with the output, pressing **Run** whenever you wish to update the output.<br>
