## Purpose

To hold data permanently in a Cyclr Account you can use the Global Data Storage Connector.  

Data persists beyond the life of any Cycle into which it is added or amended.

This data can be accessed in subsequent runs of this Cycle, or indeed _any_ Cycles within the same Cyclr Account.
