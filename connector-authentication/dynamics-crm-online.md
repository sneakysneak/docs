Partner Setup
-------------

Dynamics CRM Online uses OAuth 2. Please sign up for an application on Microsoft first and get an OAuth client ID and client secret.

Here is the official documentation for creating an Azure Active Directory application:

[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications]()

We will summarise it in a few points:

1.  Register a free Azure account or Dynamics Online trial account; log into your Azure or Dynamics Online account if you already have one.
2.  Go to Microsoft Azure portal -> Azure Active Directory -> App Registrations -> New application registration.

Below are the details you should provide:

**Name**: Your Application Name

**Application type**: Web app / API

**Sign-on URL**: https://{% raw %}{YourCyclrDomain}{% endraw %}

**Reply URLs**: https://{% raw %}{YourCyclrDomain}{% endraw %}/connector/callback

**Multi-tenanted**: Yes

**Required Permissions**: Dynamics CRM Online and Windows Azure Active Directory

3.  Go to [Cyclr Console](https://my.cyclr.com/console) > Connectors > Connector Library > Dynamics CRM Online > Setup

**Client ID**: This is the Application ID displayed in the portal

**Client Secret**: Create a Password under Microsoft Azure portal > Azure Active Directory > App Registrations > Your Application > API Access > Keys. Copy and paste the password as the client secret

Dynamics CRM Online connector is now set up! You can test it by installing it in one of your customer accounts.

API Integration Guide
---------------------

Dynamics CRM Online uses OAuth 2 Authorisation Code. The only thing to set up before getting an authentication token is to provide the domain of your Dynamics CRM Online instance.

To do this, create an account connector property named **Resource**:

```
curl -X POST 
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
     -H 'Accept: application/json' 
     -d '{
            "Name": "Resource",
            "Value": "https://example.crm.dynamics.com"
         }'
'https://api.cyclr.com/v1.0/account/connectors/DYNAMICS_ACCOUNT_CONNECTOR_ID/properties'
```

After successfully creating the account connector property, you can get a one-time sign-in token and call _/UpdateAccountConnectorOAuth_ to complete the user challenge.
