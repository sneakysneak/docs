Capsule v2 uses OAuth 2. You should sign up for an application on Capsule first and get an OAuth client ID and client secret.

Here is the official documentation for creating a Capsule OAuth 2 app:

1.  Register a free Capsule account; or log into your existing account if you already have one.

Below are the details you should provide:

**Name**: Your Application Name

**URL**: Your Cyclr Domain e.g. https://app-h.cyclr.com/

**Redirect URL**: [https://my.cyclr.com/connector/callback](https://my.cyclr.com/connector/callback), {% raw %}https://{{Your Cyclr Domain e.g. app-h.cyclr.com}}/connector/callback{% endraw %}

**Application Type**: Web Application

3.  Go to Cyclr Console (https://my.cyclr.com/console) > Connectors > Connector Library > Capsule v2 > Setup

**Client ID**: This is the Client ID displayed after you create the Capsule app

API Integration Guide
---------------------
